# CalendarioTartessos
New Royal Calendar of the State of Tommy de Fenicia, created for the newly reestablished Reino de Tartessos. The calendar is based on the Persian calendar.

**The Need to Create a Unique Calendar for Tartessos**  

I, Tommy de Fenicia, King of Tartessos, have driven the creation of an official calendar for our nation that aligns with our traditions, values, and worldview. This initiative holds profound cultural, social, and cosmic significance, rooted in the philosophy of self-determination and respect for the natural order, as established in our Constitution.  

### **Fundamental Reasons:**  

1. **National Unification:**  
   Tartessos, as a sovereign nation founded on principles of equality and cooperation, requires a system of timekeeping that reinforces our cultural identity and distinguishes our social structure. This official calendar becomes a symbol of unity and a tool to consolidate our independence in every aspect, including temporality.  

2. **Inspiration from the Persian Calendar:**  
   By adopting the precise Persian calendar, we honor Omar Khayyam and praise his remarkable contribution to time measurement. Our system incorporates its astronomical accuracy, with cycles of leap years that better reflect the Earth's natural rhythms and the cosmos. This structure surpasses the precision of the Gregorian calendar, harmonizing our relationship with the universe.  

3. **Six-Day Week:**  
   The Tartessian week, with its six days (Amadei, Soldei, Tredei, Vishnudei, Liberdei, and Kidei), represents a return to a more natural organization of time. The number six has significant cosmic resonance, being a perfect number in mathematics and a symbol of balance in many ancient cultures.  
   - **Natural Balance:** Dividing the weekly cycle into six days better aligns with biological cycles and the natural rhythms of the human body.  
   - **Efficiency and Simplicity:** A six-day week balances workdays and rest days, promoting a more harmonious and sustainable lifestyle.  
   - **Cosmic Connection:** In astronomy and mythology, the number six relates to natural hexagonal structures (such as crystals and Saturn's polar clouds), reinforcing its connection to the universe's order.  

4. **Adaptation to the Kingdom of Tartessos:**  
   This calendar, with months adapted from Persian to Latin script and unique weeks, reflects our history, cultural heritage, and geography, while respecting our Iberian and Phoenician roots.  

5. **Precise Temporal Synchronization:**  
   The Persian calendar includes a precise logic for determining the start of each year, marked by the spring equinox. This ensures that dates and days of the week remain consistent over time, facilitating planning across millennia.  

6. **Innovation and Independence:**  
   The creation of this calendar positions Tartessos as an innovative nation, capable of redefining its structures to promote collective well-being, free from temporal paradigms imposed by external systems.
